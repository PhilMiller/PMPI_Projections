This library generates Projections traces from MPI programs.

To use it, build the library with "make libpmpiprojections.a". Then link this static library in with your MPI program with "-lpmpiprojections", possibly with a "-L" flag pointing to this directory. 

Try building and running a test program included here with "make test". If your MPI implementation is setup properly, the test should succeed.

If the test fails, you can eliminate any methods that are not available for tracing by removing them from the file "mpi.h-v1-sanitized".

If you wish to trace more newer MPI 2 functions, then uncomment the MPI_PROTOTYPES_FILE definition in the Makefile to point to the larger set of MPI 2 routines.

When the MPI program is run, it will output Projections trace files to the working directory.
